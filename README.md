# Monte Carlo Probability Lab

This project is a Monte Carlo simulation framework to empirically verify
theoretical properties of probability distributions using random sampling.

## Distributions Implemented
- Uniform(0,1)
- Normal(0,1)
- Poisson(λ)
- Exponential(λ)

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Law of Large Numbers
- Estimation of mean and variance via simulation
- Probability as area under a curve
- Theory vs experimental validation
- Visualization of probability distributions

## How to Run

Run all experiments:
```bash
python main.py
